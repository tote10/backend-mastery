# Backend Learning Journey

This repository documents my step-by-step journey to becoming a backend engineer.
It is a single evolving codebase where backend concepts are learned **incrementally**
and **cumulatively**, starting from HTTP fundamentals and progressing toward
production-ready systems.

This repository is intended for **learning and experimentation**, not as a final
portfolio showcase. A separate repository will later be created for a polished,
real-world backend project.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Learn backend engineering in a **long-lived codebase**
- Practice building on top of existing code
- Understand how systems evolve over time
- Maintain consistent commit history
- Use this repo as a learning log and reference

## 🧭 Roadmap & Structure

Each folder represents a learning phase.  
Later phases may reuse, refactor, or extend earlier code.
